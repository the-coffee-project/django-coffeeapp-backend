# Coffee App Backend

This repo contains the backend code for Coffee Project's app. It provides
an API call that allows the app to retrieve data about caf√©s, and it allows
you to use the Django admin interface to manage the data.

## Running a development server

You can install the module by cloning the repo and running
`pip3 install --user --editable .` inside it.

To run a development server,  run `django-admin startproject mysite` to create
a new project. Then:

1. Add "coffeeapp\_backend" to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `mysite/settings.py`.

2. Add `url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),` to the list of URLs in your project's `urls.py`.

3. Run `python3 manage.py migrate` to create the models.

4. Start the development server using `python3 manage.py runserver`.
